Ex-70,Gulf Maine Integrated Ecosystem Assessment,Cumulative Impacts & Fisheries Management Implications,"conduct an integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA) to address tradeoffs between fisheries production and offshore wind development in the Gulf of Maine and associated management implications. An IEA is an approach to integrate all components of an ecosystem, including humans, into decision making processes. Steps of an IEA include (1) set ecosystem goals and objectives, (2) identify what data to monitor, (3) assess changes in the system and tradeoffs between management goals.
