Downloads of these files and the original points are available from the MarineCadastre.gov Data Registry Description of source data points: The geodatabase was created by computing statistical wind speed parameters for seven years of wind data from NREL’s WIND Toolkit and placing them on a GIS grid that corresponds to the existing BOEM aliquot lease grid for the Atlantic coastal region. For the Atlantic coastal region, seven years of modeled mean wind speed data on an approximately 2-km grid were obtained from NREL’s WIND Toolkit (http://www.nrel.gov/grid/wind-toolkit.html). Each 1.2-km BOEM aliquot grid cell was assigned a mean wind speed that corresponds to the nearest 2-km WIND Toolkit grid cell representing the majority of its area. The Weibull parameters were estimated by computing the parameters of a Weibull distribution that has the same mean speed and wind energy as the WIND Toolkit data. This process created a long-term, monthly, and hourly (by month and for the whole 7-year period) Weibull representation of the wind speed for each aliquot. The resulting dataset is intended to provide broad estimates of wind speed variation for the purposes of identifying possible good wind energy sites. It is not intended to provide estimates of possible energy production for the purpose of making offshore wind project investment or financing decisions in specific locations. Explanation of Attributes: Results in the geodatabase are reported on the existing 1.2 km x 1.2 km aliquot grid defined by BOEM for the Atlantic coastal region. Wind speed statistics are reported at the center point of each aliquot grid, but represent the mean values over the entire area of each grid cell. The data set delivered to BOEM is a geodatabase consisting of 14 layers. There is one layer for the long-term statistics, one layer for each month, and one polygon layer of aliquots covered by the data.

Developing seabird bioindicators for the Gulf of Maine: a demographic study of an Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea) metapopulation,University of Illinois,NA,"As climate change proceeds, ecosystems are changing rapidly. Marine ecosystems are complex and difficult to monitor, making the prediction of future changes a daunting task. Seabirds are often suggested as potential bioindicators, yet the development of their data for general predictive use is rare. I, using the data of many collaborators, examined the potential use of Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea) diet and demographic data as bioindicators in the rapidly warming Gulf of Maine (GOM) ecosystem. The collapse of the breeding colony at Machias Seal Island, formerly the largest in North America, was primarily driven by unmitigated egg predation by large Larus gulls, not a decline in Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). At the metapopulation scale, reproductive success of Arctic Terns was subject to multiple environmental interactions. The proximity of a colony to shore was associated with higher diet quality, but also greater predator pressures. Interactions between diet quality, weather, and predator behaviour strongly influenced the reproductive success of terns. At the ecosystem scale, the diets of Arctic and Common Terns (S. hirundo) could be combined with environmental data to describe and track ecosystem states. Arctic Terns were more likely to consume white hake (Urophycis tenuis) and small marine invertebrates, but their dietary trends also tracked measures of the herring stock and fishery. Common Terns were more likely to target high-lipid fish, but they showed stronger spatial trends that limited regional inferences. Finally, I estimated rates of survival, dispersal, and return rates. Arctic Terns have strong dispersal behaviour and regularly leave the major colonies of the GOM, but adult survival has not changed, despite major warming. Multiple types of tern data indicated that the weakest period of the past 30 years was between 2004-2012, when salinity was reduced and small copepods like Centropages typicus were less abundant. Arctic Terns were able to react to major declines in habitat quality, and have adjusted well to recent warming. Although Arctic Terns are affected by both top-down and bottom-up forcing, their diet and demographic data are useful as indicators. Terns could function well as ecosystem, guild-, or site-specific indicators, depending on the desired use.",Unknown,2022,Other,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362568614_Developing_seabird_bioindicators_for_the_Gulf_of_Maine_a_demographic_study_of_an_Arctic_Tern_Sterna_paradisaea_metapopulation,NA,NA,Lauren Scopel,Unknown,FishFlow,Gulf of Maine,Seabirds,Seabirds,No,spatial,,TRUE,TRUE,SO,,

"Intrinsic Seabed Habitat Vulnerability to Fishing - Bottom trawl, median fishing effort","Habitat Plan Development Team, New England Fishery Management Council","the Fisheries, Aquac Science, and Technology Laboratory at Alaska Pacific University","The Intrinsic Seabed Habitat Vulnerability to Fishing layers show the vulnerability of the seabed to each gear type. These datasets constitute a secondary set of outputs from the Northeast Fishing Effects Model (Fishing Effects). The model combines seafloor data (sediment type, energy regime) with parameters related to the interactions between fishing gear and seafloor habitats to generate habitat disturbance estimates in space and time. A higher habitat disturbance percentage suggests that the seafloor in that location is more vulnerable to that fishing gear. Mobile bottom contact gears generate higher benthic habitat disturbance values than fixed bottom contact gears. The intrinsic vulnerability products allow the Council to predict which areas would be vulnerable to impact, even in the absence of existing fishing pressure. <br/> <br/> Data inputs include a benthic sediment/energy map (in Data Explorer category Habitat > Physical) and fishing effort as swept area. Energy classification is based on depth or benthic boundary shear stress data. Data inputs and outputs to Fishing Effects are gridded at a 5 km by 5 km resolution. The model outputs extend only to the shelf break/upper continental slope because this is the limit of fishing activity with bottom-tending gears in the northeast region. The intrinsic habitat vulnerability products apply a spatially and temporally constant level of fishing disturbance for six types of bottom-tending fishing gears: trawl, scallop dredge, hydraulic clam dredge, longline, gillnet, and trap, across all grid cells of the model, at each monthly timestep from 1996-2017. The level of fishing disturbance evaluated for these model runs reflects the median swept area ratio over the entire time series and across all grid cells. Swept area ratio is simply the total swept area within each grid, relative to the grid size. For this model, which has a 25 km2 grid resolution, a swept area of 25 km2 would lead to a swept area ratio of 1, and a swept area of 12.5 km2 would lead to a swept area ratio of 0.5, etc. Values used are described in NEFMC (2019) and vary by gear type; the model report also shows results for the 95th percentile of swept area ratio. <br/> <br/> The maps in the Portal show the estimated percent seabed habitat disturbance for each of these six gear types by grid cell for the final month of the time series (December 2017), This type of product is of value to managers because fishing effort is influenced by numerous factors which are subject to change, including spatial closures that prohibit certain types of gear in specific locations. Every cell in the domain has a modeled value. Larger percentages indicate that a greater percentage of the seafloor is estimated to be impacted at these median levels of fishing disturbance, while smaller percentages indicate a lower impact. All gear types use the same color scale to allow for comparison among gears. While there are modeled differences below a 3% level, those differences are not thought to be especially meaningful in a management context, and are therefore not shown. <br/> <br/> Additional information about the model can be found on the <a href=""https://www.nefmc.org/library/fishing-effects-model"" target=""_blank"">New England Fishery Management Council's Fishing Effects</a> page.",1996,2017,Northeast Ocean Data Portal,www.northeastoceandata.org,https://services.northeastoceandata.org/arcgis1/rest/services/MarineLifeAndHabitat/MapServer/72,https://www.northeastoceandata.org/files/metadata/Themes/Habitat/FishingEffectsIntrinsicSeabedHabitatVulnerabilitymetadata.pdf,Michelle Bachman,mbachman@nefmc.org,FishFlow,North Atlantic,"Bathymetry, Habitat","Bathymetry, Habitat",Yes,spatial,,TRUE,TRUE,SO,,

Along with other plants, eelgrass forms the base of food production in the sea. Eelgrass provides shelter for juvenile fish, and invertebrates, is a site for primary settlement of the larvae of some bivalve mollusks, and in certain locations helps to stabilize unconsolidated sediments and shorelines. Between 1992 and 2013, various regions of the coast were flown and photographed. Photography was timed near low tides with low wind velocity, good water clarity, and maximum biomass of eelgrass. These factors aid in the detection of the subtidal portion a bed. Polygons delineating stands of eelgrass were screen digitized and coded using a four category scale of percent cover. Verification was carried out by boat, on foot, and by plane. Though dense patches of eelgrass approximately 6 meters in diameter and less can be identified under good conditions and in some cases were mapped, a conservative estimate of the minimum mapping unit is 150 square meters.

The role of sand lances (Ammodytes sp.) in the Northwest Atlantic Ecosystem: A synthesis of current knowledge with implications for conservation and management.,,NA,"The American sand lance (Ammodytes americanus, Ammodytidae) and the Northern sand lance (A. dubius, Ammodytidae) are small forage fishes that play an important functional role in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean (NWA). The NWA is a highly dynamic ecosystem currently facing increased risks from climate change, fishing and energy development. We need a better understanding of the biology, population dynamics and ecosystem role of Ammodytes to inform relevant management, climate adaptation and conservation efforts. To meet this need, we synthesized available data on the (a) life history, behaviour and distribution; (b) trophic ecology; (c) threats and vulnerabilities; and (d) ecosystem services role of Ammodytes in the NWA. Overall, 72 regional predators including 45 species of fishes, two squids, 16 seabirds and nine marine mammals were found to consume Ammodytes. Priority research needs identified during this effort include basic information on the patterns and drivers in abundance and distribution of Ammodytes, improved assessments of reproductive biology schedules and investigations of regional sensitivity and resilience to climate change, fishing and habitat disturbance. Food web studies are also needed to evaluate trophic linkages and to assess the consequences of inconsistent zooplankton prey and predator fields on energy flow within the NWA ecosystem. Synthesis results represent the first comprehensive assessment of Ammodytes in the NWA and are intended to inform new research and support regional ecosystem-based management approaches.",Unknown,2020,Other,https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12445,NA,NA,"Staudinger, M.

This is the first time researchers have successfully tagged an endangered species in the United States using an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone.
 
 The collected data will shed important light on the whales’ acoustic behavior, which researchers will use to inform mitigation strategies – including passive acoustic monitoring – to protect this endangered species from the potential impacts of offshore wind energy activities.
 
 Digital acoustic tagging is a component of a larger BOEM study into the Spatial and Acoustic Behavior of Endangered Large Whales to address gaps in information on a variety of endangered large whale species – including sei, North Atlantic right, and fin whales – to better inform offshore wind energy area selection. UAVs enable researchers to target specific animals in a group or conduct multi-group taggings, and the collected data will also aid in conservation efforts.

Ecological baseline study of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf off Maine,Biodiversity Research Institute,HiDef Aerial Surveying Ltd,"The objective of this study is to obtain contractor support to design and conduct multiseason boat-based and/or aerial-digital marine wildlife surveys and to establish an ecological baseline describing the distribution and abundance of marine seabirds, mammals, and sea turtles on the US OCS off Maine.
 
 The effort will coordinate with USFWS and others that may be surveying in the Gulf of Maine. A detailed field plan will be developed describing survey methods, survey protocols, proposed track lines, and survey schedule. The plan will also include details on the collection of digital imagery, methods for processing the images, camera design, and methods for identifying the species, methods to estimate bird flight heights, methods for collection of visible features of potential interest to energy development (such as oceanographic features, vessels, fishing activity [e.g., buoys], and other human uses). 
 
 The data collected from these baseline surveys will be added into databases like the Compendium of Avian Occurrence Information database and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System Spatial Ecological Analysis of Megavertebrate Populations (OBIS-SEAMAP). Ultimately, the baseline data could then be used to update avian and other wildlife distributional maps like those developed through BOEM’s interagency agreement with NOAA (Winship et al. 2018) and distributed to the regional data portals.

Gulf of Maine Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey,NOAA NEFSC,"Marine Biological Association, WHOI","A new agreement between NOAA’s Northeast Fisheries Science Center, the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, England and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will allow a plankton survey to resume. The survey was originally conducted across the Gulf of Maine from 1961 to 2017.
 The survey uses a continuous plankton recorder (CPR), a sampling device that is about 1 meter (roughly 3 feet) long. In this survey, it is towed from so-called “ships of opportunity,” such as merchant vessels. These vessels ply the same routes between ports from year to year. Scientists refer to the routes as survey transects. 
 The recorder stays at a depth of about 10 meters (roughly 33 feet). It filters and collects plankton from the water over long distances. The plankton samples are stored on silk mesh in a cartridge inside the instrument and are analyzed later in a laboratory. 
 “The value of sampling in an area accumulates each subsequent year, building a dataset of evidence and insight that we can use to understand recent changes in the marine ecosystem of the Gulf of Maine,” said David Johns, head of the CPR Survey at the Marine Biological Association. “We can compare our new dataset with the historical time series, and start to put these changes into context in a warming world.”

Expansion of the radar array to Grand Manan will allow good coverage of the EMCC and the extent to which it either veers offshore or flows through to the Western Maine Coastal Current (WMCC) throughout the year. This issue is of particular importance during the spring-summer HAB season, because the core of the EMCC is characteristically laden with Alexandrium fundyense, while the WMCC is not, so that the pathways of the EMCC are of vital importance from the PSP point of view.

Gulf of Maine North Atlantic Time Series (GNATS),Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences,NASA,"The Gulf of Maine (GoM) is a highly productive shelf sea that constitutes a large part of the N.E. US Continental Shelf. We have run a time series across the GoM for the last 8 years known as GNATS (Gulf of Maine North Atlantic Time Series). It consists of monthly, cross-Gulf sampling on ships of opportunity, during clear-sky days, so that we are assured concurrent measurements from ship and satellite (ocean color, SST). The power of this strategy is seen in our 95% success rate for being at sea during clear, high quality overpasses (randomly, one would expect a success rate of ~10% due to the GoM cloud climatology). We then can extrapolate our large shipboard data set of carbon cycle parameters to regional scales using synoptic remote sensing. GNATS includes a suite of carbon-specific standing stocks and rate measurements (e.g. POC, PIC [calcite], DOC, primary productivity, and calcification) plus hydrographic, chemical and optical measurements. Through coordinated ship/satellite measurements, we can constrain the major carbon production terms of the Gulf, follow their monthly variation using synoptic remote sensing, and regionally tune satellite algorithms. GNATS documents not only marine carbon pools, but it includes carbon supplied from the terrestrial watershed; this is why the Gulf is optically-dominated by Case II waters. We propose to A) continue GNATS, coordinated ship and satellite measurements for another 3 years, B) provide monthly, regional estimates of the standing stock and production terms for the various particulate and dissolved carbon fractions based on satellite ocean color observations and C) perform a statistical comparison of photoadaptive parameters in the Mid-Atlantic Bight and GoM to examine how broadly we can extrapolate these results along the NE U.S. Continental Shelf. Deliverables of this work will be: ship-based quantification of the various components of the carbon cycle in the GoM (standing stocks of POC, PIC, DOC plus primary production/calcification rates), an improved DOC algorithm, tuning of satellite carbon algorithms for the NE Continental Shelf, and documentation of the long- term biogeochemical and ecological changes occurring in the GoM carbon cycle. Quantification of the variability in the composition and concentration of dissolved and particulate carbon over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales is the first step towards understanding the role of coastal ecosystems in the global carbon cycle.",2001,2020,Other,https://seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov/experiment/GNATS,NA,NA,William Balch,bbalch@bigelow.org,RWSC,Gulf of Maine,"Physical oceanography, Chemical oceanography, Plankton","Physical oceanography, Chemical oceanography, Plankton","""Yes""",spatial,,TRUE,TRUE,AT,,

 The Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System (NECOFS) is an integrated atmosphere-ocean model system in which the ocean model domain covers the northeast US coastal region (New England Shelf, Georges Bank, Gulf of Maine, and Scotian Shelf) with a horizontal resolution of 10-15 km in the open ocean, 1-5 km on the shelf, and down to 20 m in estuaries, inner bays, inlets and harbors. The core system presently includes: 1) the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model modified to incorporate the COARE 2.6 air-sea flux algorithm; 2) the unstructured-grid Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) configured for this region (FVCOM-GOM3) with a nested higher resolution FVCOM grid configured for Massachusetts coastal waters (MASS Coastal FVCOM); and 3) an unstructured-grid surface wave model (FVCOM- SWAVE). NECOFS produces 3-day forecast fields of surface weather, wind stress, heat flux, surface waves, 3-D ocean velocity, temperature, and salinity; with daily updating using hindcast data assimilated fields whenever field data are available. The hourly forecast fields are made available via a THREDDS Data Server, which provides an OPeNDAP service for efficient data extraction by scientists, state and federal agencies, and application developers. The server also has a service for simple downloading of the original NetCDF output files. The unstructured-grid FVCOM-GOM3 and FVCOM-SWAVE forecast fields are also converted into uniform structured-grid NetCDF files to facilitate use by the NWS, USCG, and other users with software designed to handle regularly gridded data solely.

Ocean Tracking Network Halifax Line,Ocean Tracking Network,Fisheries and Oceans Canada,"The Atlantic Ocean off of Halifax, Nova Scotia is home to a great variety of marine species, both resident and migratory. Since 2008, the Ocean Tracking Network, with the support of DFO, has maintained an acoustic receiver curtain to track movements of a variety of acoustically tagged species moving laterally along the East Coast continental shelf, as well as year round and seasonal residents in the Halifax Region. The OTN Halifax line spans the entire width of the continental shelf off Halifax and consists of hydrophone moorings at 800 m spacing over a total length of almost 205 km. This makes it the largest single fixed oceanographic monitoring system in the world. The line meanders to avoid areas of intense trawling activity such as the Emerald Basin. In addition to acoustic receivers, several of these moorings contain benthic pods: instrumented packages that provide time series of bottom pressure (sea level height), temperature and salinity. This massive undertaking took four years to fully deploy. Data stored on receivers or benthic pods are retrieved via autonomous vehicles (gliders), as well as manned vessels. Marine species tagged in over 20 OTN projects have been detected on this line to date. This array has bennefited many telemetry investigations (salmon, sturgeon, etc) within the U.S. and Canada.

 In 2025 MassDMF initiated a passive acoustic monitoring program to enhance our understanding of the seasonal presence of North Atlantic right whales in Massachusetts coastal waters. The monitoring network includes both near real-time and archival detection methods to collect data on right whale vocalizations. DMF is partnering with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to operate two near real-time passive acoustic buoys (one in Cape Cod Bay and another off Gloucester) which relay large whale call detections via satellite every two hours. The real-time (DMON) buoys were deployed southeast of Cape Ann, and in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts on February 23, 2025. Detections can be found at the publicly accessible website Robots4Whales. In addition, DMF is deploying bottom-mounted acoustic monitors at 17 different sites across Massachusetts state waters and adjacent federal waters. These monitors are archival, collecting data for five months before being called to the surface for servicing, data downloading, and redeployment.
 
 The data collected through this acoustic monitoring network will enhance our understanding of the spatial and temporal presence of North Atlantic right whales, aid in the development of occupancy estimates, and increase the efficiency of dynamic management of fixed gear closures meant to protect right whales from entanglement. Real-time detections will improve our confidence in the decision to extend or open the closure of the Massachusetts Restricted Area due to right whale presence or absence.

Atlas of Seabirds at Sea in Eastern Canada 2006 - 2020,Government of Canada,Ships of opportunity,"The atlas provides printable maps, Web Services and downloadable data files representing seabirds at-sea densities in eastern Canada. The information provided on the open data web site can be used to identify areas where seabirds at sea are found in eastern Canada. However, low survey effort or high variation in some areas introduces uncertainty in the density estimates provided. The data and maps found on the open data web site should therefore be interpreted with an understanding of this uncertainty. Data were collected using ships of opportunity surveys and therefore spatial and seasonal coverage varies considerably. Densities are computed using distance sampling to adjust for variation in detection rates among observers and survey conditions. Depending on conditions, seabirds can be difficult to identify to species level. Therefore, densities at higher taxonomic levels are provided. more details in the document: Atlas_SeabirdsAtSea-OiseauxMarinsEnMer.pdf. By clicking on ""View on Map"" you will visualize a example of the density measured for all species combined from April to July - 2006-2020.
