MassDMF Passive Acoustic Monitoring Program - real-time and archival,Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries,WHOI,MassDMF,Marine Mammals,"Gulf of Maine,Southern New England","This project includes 2 real-time passive acoustic monitoring units (deployed in late February 2025) and 17 archival passive acoustic monitoring units (deployed in April 2025) in Massachusetts state waters.
 
 In 2025 MassDMF initiated a passive acoustic monitoring program to enhance our understanding of the seasonal presence of North Atlantic right whales in Massachusetts coastal waters. The monitoring network includes both near real-time and archival detection methods to collect data on right whale vocalizations. DMF is partnering with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to operate two near real-time passive acoustic buoys (one in Cape Cod Bay and another off Gloucester) which relay large whale call detections via satellite every two hours. The real-time (DMON) buoys were deployed southeast of Cape Ann, and in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts on February 23, 2025. Detections can be found at the publicly accessible website Robots4Whales. In addition, DMF is deploying bottom-mounted acoustic monitors at 17 different sites across Massachusetts state waters and adjacent federal waters. These monitors are archival, collecting data for five months before being called to the surface for servicing, data downloading, and redeployment.
 
 The data collected through this acoustic monitoring network will enhance our understanding of the spatial and temporal presence of North Atlantic right whales, aid in the development of occupancy estimates, and increase the efficiency of dynamic management of fixed gear closures meant to protect right whales from entanglement. Real-time detections will improve our confidence in the decision to extend or open the closure of the Massachusetts Restricted Area due to right whale presence or absence. Archival data will be analyzed for seasonal and temporal patterns in detections, aiding in the estimates of right whale density and occupancy in New England waters, which can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation measures and aid in the development of future measures to reduce risk of entanglement and ship strike.",23-Feb-25,31-Dec-50,https://www.mass.gov/info-details/conservation-of-protected-marine-species,Erin Burke,erin.burke@mass.gov,Detecting and quantifying changes to wildlife and habitats,"Passive acoustic monitoring - real-time,Passive acoustic monitoring - archival",4/17/2025

This is the first time researchers have successfully tagged an endangered species in the United States using an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone.
 
 The collected data will shed important light on the whales’ acoustic behavior, which researchers will use to inform mitigation strategies – including passive acoustic monitoring – to protect this endangered species from the potential impacts of offshore wind energy activities.
 
 Digital acoustic tagging is a component of a larger BOEM study into the Spatial and Acoustic Behavior of Endangered Large Whales to address gaps in information on a variety of endangered large whale species – including sei, North Atlantic right, and fin whales – to better inform offshore wind energy area selection. UAVs enable researchers to target specific animals in a group or conduct multi-group taggings, and the collected data will also aid in conservation efforts.
