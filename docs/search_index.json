These networks consist of platforms (e.g. buoys, shore stations, ships) outfitted with sensors that collect data which is then transmitted to back to us. Our region’s network is led by NERACOOS, the Northeastern Regional Association for Coastal and Ocean Observing. Since the early 2000s, the Ocean Data Products team at GMRI has led the data management and cyberinfrastructure (DMAC) efforts for ocean observing in the Northeast region as a key partner in NERACOOS. This role includes development and maintenance of the back-end data management system, integration of buoy and sensor data in near-real time, and the development of data access tools for stakeholders. 2.7 MaineDMR Public Health - Shellfish Water Quality Data 2.7.1 Project information Lead entity: ME DMR Partner entities: NA PI name: Wahle, Benjamin PI contact information: benjamin.wahle@maine.gov Data start year: 2019 Data end year: Present Spatial scale: Gulf of Maine 2.7.2 Data information Project link: https://dmr-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/3652bf2a35664d358e992c2e3cff9506_0/explore Data link: https://services1.arcgis.com/RbMX0mRVOFNTdLzd/arcgis/rest/services/DMRPublicHealth_WQData/FeatureServer/0 Metadata link: https://dmr-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/maine::mainedmr-public-health-shellfish-water-quality-data/about Data availability: Yes Data categories: Chemical oceanography, Molluscs Data type: spatial 2.7.3 Project description The Department of Marine Resources (DMR) Bureau of Public Health collects surface water grab samples at approximately 1,200 water quality monitoring stations along the Maine coast year-round. Samples are processed in the lab via membrane filtration and enumerated for fecal coliform bacteria. Fecal coliform results are reported as the number of colony forming units (individual bacterium capable of forming colonies) per 100mL of water. DMR scientists analyze data from each station and calculate annual summary statistics using at least 30 of the most recent samples collected under a systematic-random sampling strategy. These values, along with sanitary surveys of the area, help determine whether the water quality is acceptable for harvesting molluscan shellfish.

Some have experimented with pressure sensors, acoustic listening devices, cameras, satellite-tracked drifters, current meters, and salinity monitors but the primary focus has been monitoring temperature. While some gear are fitted with internally-recording devices that have returned more than two decades of hourly data from fixed locations, most of the vessels are now fitted with a satellite transmitter and, most recently, with cell phones so that tens of thousands of hauls have been reported in realtime since 2015. The original focus was on bottom temperature but, beginning in 2020, most vessels are now equipped with water column profilers to document the vertical stratification of temperature and several are collecting records of dissolved oxygen.

US Continental Shelf. We have run a time series across the GoM for the last 8 years known as GNATS (Gulf of Maine North Atlantic Time Series). It consists of monthly, cross-Gulf sampling on ships of opportunity, during clear-sky days, so that we are assured concurrent measurements from ship and satellite (ocean color, SST). The power of this strategy is seen in our 95% success rate for being at sea during clear, high quality overpasses (randomly, one would expect a success rate of ~10% due to the GoM cloud climatology). We then can extrapolate our large shipboard data set of carbon cycle parameters to regional scales using synoptic remote sensing. GNATS includes a suite of carbon-specific standing stocks and rate measurements (e.g. POC, PIC [calcite], DOC, primary productivity, and calcification) plus hydrographic, chemical and optical measurements. Through coordinated ship/satellite measurements, we can constrain the major carbon production terms of the Gulf, follow their monthly variation using synoptic remote sensing, and regionally tune satellite algorithms. GNATS documents not only marine carbon pools, but it includes carbon supplied from the terrestrial watershed; this is why the Gulf is optically-dominated by Case II waters. We propose to A) continue GNATS, coordinated ship and satellite measurements for another 3 years, B) provide monthly, regional estimates of the standing stock and production terms for the various particulate and dissolved carbon fractions based on satellite ocean color observations and C) perform a statistical comparison of photoadaptive parameters in the Mid-Atlantic Bight and GoM to examine how broadly we can extrapolate these results along the NE U.S. Continental Shelf. Deliverables of this work will be: ship-based quantification of the various components of the carbon cycle in the GoM (standing stocks of POC, PIC, DOC plus primary production/calcification rates), an improved DOC algorithm, tuning of satellite carbon algorithms for the NE Continental Shelf, and documentation of the long- term biogeochemical and ecological changes occurring in the GoM carbon cycle. Quantification of the variability in the composition and concentration of dissolved and particulate carbon over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales is the first step towards understanding the role of coastal ecosystems in the global carbon cycle.

Downloads of these files and the original points are available from the MarineCadastre.gov Data Registry Description of source data points: The geodatabase was created by computing statistical wind speed parameters for seven years of wind data from NREL’s WIND Toolkit and placing them on a GIS grid that corresponds to the existing BOEM aliquot lease grid for the Atlantic coastal region. For the Atlantic coastal region, seven years of modeled mean wind speed data on an approximately 2-km grid were obtained from NREL’s WIND Toolkit (http://www.nrel.gov/grid/wind-toolkit.html). Each 1.2-km BOEM aliquot grid cell was assigned a mean wind speed that corresponds to the nearest 2-km WIND Toolkit grid cell representing the majority of its area. The Weibull parameters were estimated by computing the parameters of a Weibull distribution that has the same mean speed and wind energy as the WIND Toolkit data. This process created a long-term, monthly, and hourly (by month and for the whole 7-year period) Weibull representation of the wind speed for each aliquot. The resulting dataset is intended to provide broad estimates of wind speed variation for the purposes of identifying possible good wind energy sites. It is not intended to provide estimates of possible energy production for the purpose of making offshore wind project investment or financing decisions in specific locations. Explanation of Attributes: Results in the geodatabase are reported on the existing 1.2 km x 1.2 km aliquot grid defined by BOEM for the Atlantic coastal region. Wind speed statistics are reported at the center point of each aliquot grid, but represent the mean values over the entire area of each grid cell. The data set delivered to BOEM is a geodatabase consisting of 14 layers. There is one layer for the long-term statistics, one layer for each month, and one polygon layer of aliquots covered by the data. The long-term shapefile includes mean wind speed and Weibull parameters to capture the long-term wind speed distribution of the entire 7-year time series. Each monthly shapefile contains mean wind speed and Weibull parameters for that month overall and for each hour of the day within that month. All times are in EST (UTC-5).

Concerns that areas with significant fish biomass were not being sampled resulted in the NEFSC developing a summer bottom trawl survey in order to supplement sampling in this region. The NEFSC worked with regional fisherman to map areas accessible to bottom trawls and used this information to develop a sampling regime. A master list of towable areas was used to inform the stratified-random survey design which allowed sampling in these areas, while greatly reducing gear damage. This survey was conducted from 1991 through 1995. 3.5 CurrentMagnitudeDirection 3.5.1 Project information Lead entity: NOAA Partner entities: NA PI name: NOAA OCM PI contact information: coastal.info@noaa.gov Data start year: 2022 Data end year: 2024 Spatial scale: USA 3.5.2 Data information Project link: https://coast.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OceanReports/CurrentMagnitudeDirection/MapServer Data link: https://coast.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OceanReports/CurrentMagnitudeDirection/MapServer/0 Metadata link: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/66127 Data availability: Yes Data categories: Physical oceanography Data type: spatial 3.5.3 Project description Feature layer of annually averaged direction and magnitude of currents 3.6 EMU_Salinity 3.6.1 Project information Lead entity: NOAA Partner entities: NA PI name: NOAA OCM PI contact information: coastal.info@noaa.gov Data start year: 2021 Data end year: 2024 Spatial scale: USA 3.6.2 Data information Project link: https://coast.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OceanReports/EMU_Salinity/MapServer Data link: https://coast.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OceanReports/EMU_Salinity/MapServer/0 Metadata link: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/66137 Data availability: Yes Data categories: Physical oceanography Data type: spatial 3.6.3 Project description A compilation of ocean water quality (temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) data at ¼ degree spatial resolution for the entire United States Exclusive Economic Zone.

It runs annually in the spring (April to May) and again in the late fall (October to November). To ensure that our survey data complements data collected during our bottom trawl surveys, we sample in the same areas in that part of the Gulf and use the same methods for selecting sampling stations within each area. We sample at 38 rough-bottom stations and seven smooth-bottom stations each season. This results in station density comparable to that of our bottom trawl surveys, but weighted to sample more stations in structured habitat. The survey is operated from collaborating commercial fishing vessels, and deploys 1 nm sets of traditional ‘tub trawl’ bottom longline groundfish gear (1000 hooks). 3.15 NERACOOS Mariner’s Dashboard - Daily Climatology 3.15.1 Project information Lead entity: NERACOOS Partner entities: NA PI name: Bland, K &amp; Motya, J PI contact information: katy@neracoos.org, jackie@neracoos.org, Data start year: 2001 Data end year: Present Spatial scale: Northwest Atlantic 3.15.2 Data information Project link: https://p5.neracoos.org/products/clim_test/drupal_clim.html Data link: NA Metadata link: NA Data availability: Yes Data categories: Physical oceanography Data type: spatial 3.15.3 Project description Unknown 3.16 NERACOOS Mariner’s Dashboard - Latest Conditions 3.16.1 Project information Lead entity: NERACOOS Partner entities: NA PI name: Bland, K &amp; Motya, J PI contact information: katy@neracoos.org, jackie@neracoos.org Data start year: multiple Data end year: Present Spatial scale: Northwest Atlantic 3.16.2 Data information Project link: https://mariners.neracoos.org/platform/CDIP221 Data link: NA Metadata link: NA Data availability: Yes Data categories: Physical oceanography Data type: spatial 3.16.3 Project description Unknown 3.17 OceanObservingSites 3.17.1 Project information Lead entity: NOAA Partner entities: NA PI name: NOAA OCM PI contact information: coastal.info@noaa.gov Data start year: 2022 Data end year: 2024 Spatial scale: USA 3.17.2 Data information Project link: https://coast.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OceanReports/OceanObservingSites/MapServer Data link: https://coast.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OceanReports/OceanObservingSites/MapServer/0 Metadata link: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/67000 Data availability: Yes Data categories: Physical oceanography Data type: spatial 3.17.3 Project description Feature layer (points) the location of ocean observing assets within U.S. waters, and the physical parameters generally collected at each platform or gauge 3.18 Oceanographic monitoring 3.18.1 Project information Lead entity: UMaine, WHOI Partner entities: NA PI name: Gerbi, Greg (UMaine) with Anthony Kirincich (WHOI), Neal Pettigrew (UMaine) PI contact information: gregory.gerbi@maine.edu Data start year: 2023 Data end year: Present Spatial scale: Gulf of Maine 3.18.2 Data information Project link: https://umaine.edu/marine/people/greg-gerbi-ph-d/ Data link: NA Metadata link: NA Data availability: No Data categories: Physical oceanography Data type: spatial 3.18.3 Project description Newly funded research project by Dr. Greg Gerbi.

Some have experimented with pressure sensors, acoustic listening devices, cameras, satellite-tracked drifters, current meters, and salinity monitors but the primary focus has been monitoring temperature. While some gear are fitted with internally-recording devices that have returned more than two decades of hourly data from fixed locations, most of the vessels are now fitted with a satellite transmitter and, most recently, with cell phones so that tens of thousands of hauls have been reported in realtime since 2015. The original focus was on bottom temperature but, beginning in 2020, most vessels are now equipped with water column profilers to document the vertical stratification of temperature and several are collecting records of dissolved oxygen.

Increased CODAR coverage in the Gulf of Maine allows scientists to understand the flow the Eastern Maine Coastal Current (EMCC). Expansion of the radar array to Grand Manan will allow good coverage of the EMCC and the extent to which it either veers offshore or flows through to the Western Maine Coastal Current (WMCC) throughout the year. This issue is of particular importance during the spring-summer HAB season, because the core of the EMCC is characteristically laden with Alexandrium fundyense, while the WMCC is not, so that the pathways of the EMCC are of vital importance from the PSP point of view. Understanding these surface currents is also critical for applications such as search and rescue, prediction of pollutant transport, and determining the delivery of larvae of commercially important species, including lobster and scallops, to the western Gulf.

US Continental Shelf. We have run a time series across the GoM for the last 8 years known as GNATS (Gulf of Maine North Atlantic Time Series). It consists of monthly, cross-Gulf sampling on ships of opportunity, during clear-sky days, so that we are assured concurrent measurements from ship and satellite (ocean color, SST). The power of this strategy is seen in our 95% success rate for being at sea during clear, high quality overpasses (randomly, one would expect a success rate of ~10% due to the GoM cloud climatology). We then can extrapolate our large shipboard data set of carbon cycle parameters to regional scales using synoptic remote sensing. GNATS includes a suite of carbon-specific standing stocks and rate measurements (e.g. POC, PIC [calcite], DOC, primary productivity, and calcification) plus hydrographic, chemical and optical measurements. Through coordinated ship/satellite measurements, we can constrain the major carbon production terms of the Gulf, follow their monthly variation using synoptic remote sensing, and regionally tune satellite algorithms. GNATS documents not only marine carbon pools, but it includes carbon supplied from the terrestrial watershed; this is why the Gulf is optically-dominated by Case II waters. We propose to A) continue GNATS, coordinated ship and satellite measurements for another 3 years, B) provide monthly, regional estimates of the standing stock and production terms for the various particulate and dissolved carbon fractions based on satellite ocean color observations and C) perform a statistical comparison of photoadaptive parameters in the Mid-Atlantic Bight and GoM to examine how broadly we can extrapolate these results along the NE U.S. Continental Shelf. Deliverables of this work will be: ship-based quantification of the various components of the carbon cycle in the GoM (standing stocks of POC, PIC, DOC plus primary production/calcification rates), an improved DOC algorithm, tuning of satellite carbon algorithms for the NE Continental Shelf, and documentation of the long- term biogeochemical and ecological changes occurring in the GoM carbon cycle. Quantification of the variability in the composition and concentration of dissolved and particulate carbon over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales is the first step towards understanding the role of coastal ecosystems in the global carbon cycle.

The core system presently includes: 1) the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model modified to incorporate the COARE 2.6 air-sea flux algorithm; 2) the unstructured-grid Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) configured for this region (FVCOM-GOM3) with a nested higher resolution FVCOM grid configured for Massachusetts coastal waters (MASS Coastal FVCOM); and 3) an unstructured-grid surface wave model (FVCOM- SWAVE). NECOFS produces 3-day forecast fields of surface weather, wind stress, heat flux, surface waves, 3-D ocean velocity, temperature, and salinity; with daily updating using hindcast data assimilated fields whenever field data are available. The hourly forecast fields are made available via a THREDDS Data Server, which provides an OPeNDAP service for efficient data extraction by scientists, state and federal agencies, and application developers. The server also has a service for simple downloading of the original NetCDF output files. The unstructured-grid FVCOM-GOM3 and FVCOM-SWAVE forecast fields are also converted into uniform structured-grid NetCDF files to facilitate use by the NWS, USCG, and other users with software designed to handle regularly gridded data solely. NECOFS has been developed as part of the IOOS-funded Northeast Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS).

Since 2008, the Ocean Tracking Network, with the support of DFO, has maintained an acoustic receiver curtain to track movements of a variety of acoustically tagged species moving laterally along the East Coast continental shelf, as well as year round and seasonal residents in the Halifax Region. The OTN Halifax line spans the entire width of the continental shelf off Halifax and consists of hydrophone moorings at 800 m spacing over a total length of almost 205 km. This makes it the largest single fixed oceanographic monitoring system in the world. The line meanders to avoid areas of intense trawling activity such as the Emerald Basin. In addition to acoustic receivers, several of these moorings contain benthic pods: instrumented packages that provide time series of bottom pressure (sea level height), temperature and salinity. This massive undertaking took four years to fully deploy. Data stored on receivers or benthic pods are retrieved via autonomous vehicles (gliders), as well as manned vessels. Marine species tagged in over 20 OTN projects have been detected on this line to date. This array has bennefited many telemetry investigations (salmon, sturgeon, etc) within the U.S. and Canada.

These datasets constitute a secondary set of outputs from the Northeast Fishing Effects Model (Fishing Effects). The model combines seafloor data (sediment type, energy regime) with parameters related to the interactions between fishing gear and seafloor habitats to generate habitat disturbance estimates in space and time. A higher habitat disturbance percentage suggests that the seafloor in that location is more vulnerable to that fishing gear. Mobile bottom contact gears generate higher benthic habitat disturbance values than fixed bottom contact gears. The intrinsic vulnerability products allow the Council to predict which areas would be vulnerable to impact, even in the absence of existing fishing pressure. Data inputs include a benthic sediment/energy map (in Data Explorer category Habitat &gt; Physical) and fishing effort as swept area. Energy classification is based on depth or benthic boundary shear stress data. Data inputs and outputs to Fishing Effects are gridded at a 5 km by 5 km resolution. The model outputs extend only to the shelf break/upper continental slope because this is the limit of fishing activity with bottom-tending gears in the northeast region. The intrinsic habitat vulnerability products apply a spatially and temporally constant level of fishing disturbance for six types of bottom-tending fishing gears: trawl, scallop dredge, hydraulic clam dredge, longline, gillnet, and trap, across all grid cells of the model, at each monthly timestep from 1996-2017. The level of fishing disturbance evaluated for these model runs reflects the median swept area ratio over the entire time series and across all grid cells. Swept area ratio is simply the total swept area within each grid, relative to the grid size. For this model, which has a 25 km2 grid resolution, a swept area of 25 km2 would lead to a swept area ratio of 1, and a swept area of 12.5 km2 would lead to a swept area ratio of 0.5, etc. Values used are described in NEFMC (2019) and vary by gear type; the model report also shows results for the 95th percentile of swept area ratio. The maps in the Portal show the estimated percent seabed habitat disturbance for each of these six gear types by grid cell for the final month of the time series (December 2017), This type of product is of value to managers because fishing effort is influenced by numerous factors which are subject to change, including spatial closures that prohibit certain types of gear in specific locations. Every cell in the domain has a modeled value. Larger percentages indicate that a greater percentage of the seafloor is estimated to be impacted at these median levels of fishing disturbance, while smaller percentages indicate a lower impact. All gear types use the same color scale to allow for comparison among gears. While there are modeled differences below a 3% level, those differences are not thought to be especially meaningful in a management context, and are therefore not shown. Additional information about the model can be found on the New England Fishery Management Council’s Fishing Effects page. 4.14 Intrinsic Seabed Habitat Vulnerability to Fishing - Gillnet, median fishing effort 4.14.1 Project information Lead entity: Habitat Plan Development Team, New England Fishery Management Council Partner entities: the Fisheries, Aquac Science, and Technology Laboratory at Alaska Pacific University PI name: Michelle Bachman PI contact information: mbachman@nefmc.org Data start year: 1996 Data end year: 2017 Spatial scale: Northwest Atlantic 4.14.2 Data information Project link: www.northeastoceandata.org Data link: https://services.northeastoceandata.org/arcgis1/rest/services/MarineLifeAndHabitat/MapServer/75 Metadata link: https://www.northeastoceandata.org/files/metadata/Themes/Habitat/FishingEffectsIntrinsicSeabedHabitatVulnerabilitymetadata.pdf Data availability: Yes Data categories: Bathymetry, Habitat Data type: spatial 4.14.3 Project description The Intrinsic Seabed Habitat Vulnerability to Fishing layers show the vulnerability of the seabed to each gear type.

Five different sediment grain sizes plus a steep and deep habitat type are represented in the dataset, which indicates the proportion of each grain size occurring within each 5x5 km grid cell based on available data (primarily from the USGS and SMAST drop camera survey dataset). In areas where there were existing polygon interpretations of sediments, these are used instead of the point-based interpolations to determine the percent sediment values in the final sediment dataset. For each grid cell, the proportions across the five grain sizes and steep and deep habitat type sum to 1, such that the area of the grid cell is fully allocated to one or more of the six conditions. The legends and color ramps for each of the five grain size layers are unique so as to display the range of variability within each layer. The model domain is fromthe U.S./Canadian border to the N.C./S.C. border, and inshore to offshore from the coastline to the Exclusive Economic Zone boundary. A secondary purpose for these maps of sediment grain sizes is to inform various spatial planning issues where seabed type is a consideration for decision making. It is important to understand caveats and limitations associated with both the underlying source data and this compilation when using the data for spatial planning.

These datasets constitute a secondary set of outputs from the Northeast Fishing Effects Model (Fishing Effects). The model combines seafloor data (sediment type, energy regime) with parameters related to the interactions between fishing gear and seafloor habitats to generate habitat disturbance estimates in space and time. A higher habitat disturbance percentage suggests that the seafloor in that location is more vulnerable to that fishing gear. Mobile bottom contact gears generate higher benthic habitat disturbance values than fixed bottom contact gears. The intrinsic vulnerability products allow the Council to predict which areas would be vulnerable to impact, even in the absence of existing fishing pressure. Data inputs include a benthic sediment/energy map (in Data Explorer category Habitat &gt; Physical) and fishing effort as swept area. Energy classification is based on depth or benthic boundary shear stress data. Data inputs and outputs to Fishing Effects are gridded at a 5 km by 5 km resolution. The model outputs extend only to the shelf break/upper continental slope because this is the limit of fishing activity with bottom-tending gears in the northeast region. The intrinsic habitat vulnerability products apply a spatially and temporally constant level of fishing disturbance for six types of bottom-tending fishing gears: trawl, scallop dredge, hydraulic clam dredge, longline, gillnet, and trap, across all grid cells of the model, at each monthly timestep from 1996-2017. The level of fishing disturbance evaluated for these model runs reflects the median swept area ratio over the entire time series and across all grid cells. Swept area ratio is simply the total swept area within each grid, relative to the grid size. For this model, which has a 25 km2 grid resolution, a swept area of 25 km2 would lead to a swept area ratio of 1, and a swept area of 12.5 km2 would lead to a swept area ratio of 0.5, etc. Values used are described in NEFMC (2019) and vary by gear type; the model report also shows results for the 95th percentile of swept area ratio. The maps in the Portal show the estimated percent seabed habitat disturbance for each of these six gear types by grid cell for the final month of the time series (December 2017), This type of product is of value to managers because fishing effort is influenced by numerous factors which are subject to change, including spatial closures that prohibit certain types of gear in specific locations. Every cell in the domain has a modeled value. Larger percentages indicate that a greater percentage of the seafloor is estimated to be impacted at these median levels of fishing disturbance, while smaller percentages indicate a lower impact. All gear types use the same color scale to allow for comparison among gears. While there are modeled differences below a 3% level, those differences are not thought to be especially meaningful in a management context, and are therefore not shown. Additional information about the model can be found on the New England Fishery Management Council’s Fishing Effects page. 5.14 Intrinsic Seabed Habitat Vulnerability to Fishing - Gillnet, median fishing effort 5.14.1 Project information Lead entity: Habitat Plan Development Team, New England Fishery Management Council Partner entities: the Fisheries, Aquac Science, and Technology Laboratory at Alaska Pacific University PI name: Michelle Bachman PI contact information: mbachman@nefmc.org Data start year: 1996 Data end year: 2017 Spatial scale: Northwest Atlantic 5.14.2 Data information Project link: www.northeastoceandata.org Data link: https://services.northeastoceandata.org/arcgis1/rest/services/MarineLifeAndHabitat/MapServer/75 Metadata link: https://www.northeastoceandata.org/files/metadata/Themes/Habitat/FishingEffectsIntrinsicSeabedHabitatVulnerabilitymetadata.pdf Data availability: Yes Data categories: Bathymetry, Habitat Data type: spatial 5.14.3 Project description The Intrinsic Seabed Habitat Vulnerability to Fishing layers show the vulnerability of the seabed to each gear type.

A higher habitat disturbance percentage suggests that the seafloor in that location is more vulnerable to that fishing gear. 5.19 It’s about time: A synthesis of changing phenology in the Gulf of Maine Ecosystem. 5.19.1 Project information Lead entity: USGS Partner entities: GMRI; Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences; Center for Coastal Studies; University of New Brunswick; NMFS - NEFSC; Stoney Brook University; WHOI; Fisheries and Oceans Canada; VIMS; University of Massachusetts Amherst; US EPA New England; NeAq; Connecticut Ornithological Association; University of Maine PI name: Staudinger, M.D., K.

Maine’s eelgrass meadows form an important marine and estuarine coastal aquatic habitat for the state. Along with other plants, eelgrass forms the base of food production in the sea. Eelgrass provides shelter for juvenile fish, and invertebrates, is a site for primary settlement of the larvae of some bivalve mollusks, and in certain locations helps to stabilize unconsolidated sediments and shorelines. Between 1992 and 2013, various regions of the coast were flown and photographed. Photography was timed near low tides with low wind velocity, good water clarity, and maximum biomass of eelgrass. These factors aid in the detection of the subtidal portion a bed. Polygons delineating stands of eelgrass were screen digitized and coded using a four category scale of percent cover. Verification was carried out by boat, on foot, and by plane. Though dense patches of eelgrass approximately 6 meters in diameter and less can be identified under good conditions and in some cases were mapped, a conservative estimate of the minimum mapping unit is 150 square meters. This represents a stand of approximately 14 meters in diameter. 5.21 MaineDMR - Eelgrass Distribution Change 1997/2010 5.21.1 Project information Lead entity: ME DMR Partner entities: NA PI name: DeVoe, William PI contact information: william.devoe@maine.gov Data start year: 1992 Data end year: 2010 Spatial scale: Gulf of Maine 5.21.2 Data information Project link: https://dmr-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d0db0cbc5cde4ecf80ade193cdc0f8d4_0/explore Data link: https://services1.arcgis.com/RbMX0mRVOFNTdLzd/arcgis/rest/services/MaineDMR_Eelgrass_Distribution_Change_1997_and_2010/FeatureServer/0 Metadata link: https://dmr-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/maine::mainedmr-eelgrass-distribution-change-1997-2010/about Data availability: Yes Data categories: Habitat Data type: spatial 5.21.3 Project description This layer represents changes in coastwide eelgrass distribution for the State of Maine from surveys conducted 1992-1997 and 2001-2010.

Five different sediment grain sizes plus a steep and deep habitat type are represented in the dataset, which indicates the proportion of each grain size occurring within each 5x5 km grid cell based on available data (primarily from the USGS and SMAST drop camera survey dataset). In areas where there were existing polygon interpretations of sediments, these are used instead of the point-based interpolations to determine the percent sediment values in the final sediment dataset. For each grid cell, the proportions across the five grain sizes and steep and deep habitat type sum to 1, such that the area of the grid cell is fully allocated to one or more of the six conditions. The legends and color ramps for each of the five grain size layers are unique so as to display the range of variability within each layer. The model domain is fromthe U.S./Canadian border to the N.C./S.C. border, and inshore to offshore from the coastline to the Exclusive Economic Zone boundary. A secondary purpose for these maps of sediment grain sizes is to inform various spatial planning issues where seabed type is a consideration for decision making. It is important to understand caveats and limitations associated with both the underlying source data and this compilation when using the data for spatial planning.

Sediment type and diversity values in cells with fewer observations may be less reliable than values calculated for grids with more grain size observations. This layer essentially serves as a data quality assessment, so users can visualize the limitations associated with both the underlying source data and this compilation when using the data for spatial planning. These limitations and caveats influence the Fishing Effects model percent habitat disturbance results as well. In areas where there were existing polygon interpretations of sediments, the polygons were used instead of the point-based interpolations to determine the percent sediment values in the final sediment dataset. The polygon data are not included in this sediment data density product, only points. The detailed metadata document includes maps of where polygon data were used to classify habitat type.

The maximum diversity is five, since there are five grain size classes: mud, sand, granule/pebble, cobble, and boulder. The grain size distribution was modeled based on available data (primarily from the USGS and SMAST drop camera survey dataset, and also from various sediment polygon data sources). This layer provides a rough indication of the diversity of sediment types within a cell. The associated map of sediment grain size diversity can be used to inform various spatial planning issues where seabed diversity is a consideration for decision making.

The historical eelgrass extent layer was created from several separate datasets for the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York. Datasets that were included in the historical layer were derived from quantitative surveys such as aerial photography and/or field verification. The range of historical data available varied greatly by state. The data user is encouraged to read this and the metadata of each individual state’s data carefully, as geometry, attribute details, and timeliness are not necessarily consistent among datasets used to develop this layer. All of the datasets used to develop the historical eelgrass extent layer are available separately for download at https://www.northeastoceandata.org/eelgrass/.

The NWA is a highly dynamic ecosystem currently facing increased risks from climate change, fishing and energy development. We need a better understanding of the biology, population dynamics and ecosystem role of Ammodytes to inform relevant management, climate adaptation and conservation efforts. To meet this need, we synthesized available data on the (a) life history, behaviour and distribution; (b) trophic ecology; (c) threats and vulnerabilities; and (d) ecosystem services role of Ammodytes in the NWA. Overall, 72 regional predators including 45 species of fishes, two squids, 16 seabirds and nine marine mammals were found to consume Ammodytes. Priority research needs identified during this effort include basic information on the patterns and drivers in abundance and distribution of Ammodytes, improved assessments of reproductive biology schedules and investigations of regional sensitivity and resilience to climate change, fishing and habitat disturbance. Food web studies are also needed to evaluate trophic linkages and to assess the consequences of inconsistent zooplankton prey and predator fields on energy flow within the NWA ecosystem. Synthesis results represent the first comprehensive assessment of Ammodytes in the NWA and are intended to inform new research and support regional ecosystem-based management approaches. 5.45 Tidal marsh vegetation classification 5.45.1 Project information Lead entity: Saltmarsh Habitat and Avian Research Program Partner entities: NA PI name: Mo Correll PI contact information: Unknown Data start year: 2017 Data end year: Present Spatial scale: Northwest Atlantic 5.45.2 Data information Project link: https://www.tidalmarshbirds.org/?page_id=1871 Data link: https://gis.usgs.gov/sciencebase2/rest/services/Catalog/5a4d4db3e4b0d05ee8c4d195/MapServer Metadata link: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a4d4db3e4b0d05ee8c4d195 Data availability: Yes Data categories: Habitat Data type: spatial 5.45.3 Project description This dataset represents salt marsh communities in the Northeast Atlantic coast.

The survey was originally conducted across the Gulf of Maine from 1961 to 2017. The survey uses a continuous plankton recorder (CPR), a sampling device that is about 1 meter (roughly 3 feet) long. In this survey, it is towed from so-called “ships of opportunity,” such as merchant vessels. These vessels ply the same routes between ports from year to year. Scientists refer to the routes as survey transects. The recorder stays at a depth of about 10 meters (roughly 33 feet). It filters and collects plankton from the water over long distances. The plankton samples are stored on silk mesh in a cartridge inside the instrument and are analyzed later in a laboratory. “The value of sampling in an area accumulates each subsequent year, building a dataset of evidence and insight that we can use to understand recent changes in the marine ecosystem of the Gulf of Maine,” said David Johns, head of the CPR Survey at the Marine Biological Association. “We can compare our new dataset with the historical time series, and start to put these changes into context in a warming world.” Data can be found here: https://obis.org/dataset/9ad0f8eb-b983-418d-b881-3b672d9e0005 [1] “This data was sourced from: RWSC_early-2025” 6.10 Gulf of Maine Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) 6.10.1 Project information Lead entity: Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) Partner entities: BOEM, NERACOOS, NROC, U.S. IOOS PI name: Jeffery Runge PI contact information: jeffrey.runge@maine.edu Data start year: 2019 Data end year: 2050 Spatial scale: Gulf of Maine 6.10.2 Data information Project link: https://marinebon.org/us-mbon/gulf-of-maine/ Data link: https://www.neracoos.org/erddap/search/index.html?page=1&amp;itemsPerPage=1000&amp;searchFor=wbts Metadata link: NA Data availability: No Data categories: Plankton Data type: spatial 6.10.3 Project description This MBON project will address a crucial gap for understanding phenological and long-term change in the Gulf of Maine marine ecosystem that has been identified by the Integrated Sentinel Monitoring Network (ISMN) - namely, time series observations of plankton biodiversity at subannual scales. Time series collections will be conducted at a station located in Wilkinson Basin in western Gulf of Maine and a station located in the Maine Coastal Current. NERACOOS and NROC, and the ISMN will undertake responsibility for finding sustained support of these time series, which were established over a decade ago. Phytoplankton and micro and mesozooplankton abundance and species diversity will be microscopically enumerated, and water samples for processing with an Imaging FlowCytobot and eDNA will be collected and analyzed. The ISMN will incorporate a citizen-science initiative to document jellyfish abundance. The observations thus compare traditional with new approaches to biodiversity assessment, expanding MBON into a coastal ecosystem where change is occurring rapidly.

US Continental Shelf. We have run a time series across the GoM for the last 8 years known as GNATS (Gulf of Maine North Atlantic Time Series). It consists of monthly, cross-Gulf sampling on ships of opportunity, during clear-sky days, so that we are assured concurrent measurements from ship and satellite (ocean color, SST). The power of this strategy is seen in our 95% success rate for being at sea during clear, high quality overpasses (randomly, one would expect a success rate of ~10% due to the GoM cloud climatology). We then can extrapolate our large shipboard data set of carbon cycle parameters to regional scales using synoptic remote sensing. GNATS includes a suite of carbon-specific standing stocks and rate measurements (e.g. POC, PIC [calcite], DOC, primary productivity, and calcification) plus hydrographic, chemical and optical measurements. Through coordinated ship/satellite measurements, we can constrain the major carbon production terms of the Gulf, follow their monthly variation using synoptic remote sensing, and regionally tune satellite algorithms. GNATS documents not only marine carbon pools, but it includes carbon supplied from the terrestrial watershed; this is why the Gulf is optically-dominated by Case II waters. We propose to A) continue GNATS, coordinated ship and satellite measurements for another 3 years, B) provide monthly, regional estimates of the standing stock and production terms for the various particulate and dissolved carbon fractions based on satellite ocean color observations and C) perform a statistical comparison of photoadaptive parameters in the Mid-Atlantic Bight and GoM to examine how broadly we can extrapolate these results along the NE U.S. Continental Shelf. Deliverables of this work will be: ship-based quantification of the various components of the carbon cycle in the GoM (standing stocks of POC, PIC, DOC plus primary production/calcification rates), an improved DOC algorithm, tuning of satellite carbon algorithms for the NE Continental Shelf, and documentation of the long- term biogeochemical and ecological changes occurring in the GoM carbon cycle.

The NWA is a highly dynamic ecosystem currently facing increased risks from climate change, fishing and energy development. We need a better understanding of the biology, population dynamics and ecosystem role of Ammodytes to inform relevant management, climate adaptation and conservation efforts. To meet this need, we synthesized available data on the (a) life history, behaviour and distribution; (b) trophic ecology; (c) threats and vulnerabilities; and (d) ecosystem services role of Ammodytes in the NWA. Overall, 72 regional predators including 45 species of fishes, two squids, 16 seabirds and nine marine mammals were found to consume Ammodytes. Priority research needs identified during this effort include basic information on the patterns and drivers in abundance and distribution of Ammodytes, improved assessments of reproductive biology schedules and investigations of regional sensitivity and resilience to climate change, fishing and habitat disturbance. Food web studies are also needed to evaluate trophic linkages and to assess the consequences of inconsistent zooplankton prey and predator fields on energy flow within the NWA ecosystem. Synthesis results represent the first comprehensive assessment of Ammodytes in the NWA and are intended to inform new research and support regional ecosystem-based management approaches. 7.8 Maine eDNA 7.8.1 Project information Lead entity: University of Maine Partner entities: NA PI name: Unknown PI contact information: https://umaine.edu/edna/contact-us/ Data start year: 2020 Data end year: 2025 Spatial scale: State 7.8.2 Data information Project link: https://umaine.edu/edna/ Data link: NA Metadata link: NA Data availability: No Data categories: Sea turtles, Seabirds, Plankton, Marine mammals, Protected fish, Highly migratory fish, Forage fish, Groundfish Data type: “research project, synthesis, or technology development” 7.8.3 Project description Maine eDNA is a 5-year research, education, and outreach program that seeks to transform our understanding and sustainability of Maine’s coastal ecosystems via environmental DNA (eDNA) innovations that unlock new scales of inference and new scales of collaboration.

We are also examining how the feeding and movements of two important consumers, the common tern and Atlantic cod, respond to local marine biodiversity through diet analyses and telemetry. Bioenergetics models of these species will be developed to predict how changes in water temperature and diet may affect Atlantic cod and terns. Comparing and contrasting species’ responses to environmental change helps determine the “winners and losers” of climate change.

It runs annually in the spring (April to May) and again in the late fall (October to November). To ensure that our survey data complements data collected during our bottom trawl surveys, we sample in the same areas in that part of the Gulf and use the same methods for selecting sampling stations within each area. We sample at 38 rough-bottom stations and seven smooth-bottom stations each season. This results in station density comparable to that of our bottom trawl surveys, but weighted to sample more stations in structured habitat.

We are also examining how the feeding and movements of two important consumers, the common tern and Atlantic cod, respond to local marine biodiversity through diet analyses and telemetry. Bioenergetics models of these species will be developed to predict how changes in water temperature and diet may affect Atlantic cod and terns. Comparing and contrasting species’ responses to environmental change helps determine the “winners and losers” of climate change. All efforts each year are informed by a variety of stakeholders representing resource managers and non-profit organizations, including New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, National Marine Fisheries Service, Maine Department of Marine Resources, National Audubon Society, and the Piscataqua Region Estuarine Partnership.

Concerns that areas with significant fish biomass were not being sampled resulted in the NEFSC developing a summer bottom trawl survey in order to supplement sampling in this region. The NEFSC worked with regional fisherman to map areas accessible to bottom trawls and used this information to develop a sampling regime. A master list of towable areas was used to inform the stratified-random survey design which allowed sampling in these areas, while greatly reducing gear damage. This survey was conducted from 1991 through 1995. 9.4 Evaluating Age Structure, Aging Bias and Mixed Stock Composition of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna in the Northwest Atlantic 9.4.1 Project information Lead entity: GMRI Partner entities: NA PI name: Golet, W PI contact information: wgolet@gmri.org Data start year: 2019 Data end year: 2023 Spatial scale: Northwest Atlantic 9.4.2 Data information Project link: https://www.gmri.org/projects/bluefin-tuna-research/ Data link: NA Metadata link: NA Data availability: No Data categories: Highly migratory fish Data type: “research project, synthesis, or technology development” 9.4.3 Project description Atlantic bluefin tuna are one of the oceans most magnificent fish. They can grow up to 12 feet in length, weigh almost 2,000 pounds, and migrate tens of thousands of miles each year. Humans have used these fish as sources of local protein for thousands of years, and now as product of commerce in commercial fisheries. Many recreational anglers also target bluefin due to their size, strength, and the quality of their meat. Despite decades of study, many of the most important aspects of this fish’s life elude us. Over the past two decades scientists have invested substantial time and funding studying the life history of these fish to learn more about their biology, improve our ability to assess the status of their stocks, and ultimately improve their sustainability. 9.5 HighlyMigratorySpecies_Fish 9.5.1 Project information Lead entity: NOAA Partner entities: NA PI name: NOAA OCM PI contact information: coastal.info@noaa.gov Data start year: 2021 Data end year: 2024 Spatial scale: USA 9.5.2 Data information Project link: https://coast.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OceanReports/HighlyMigratorySpecies_Fish/MapServer Data link: https://coast.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OceanReports/HighlyMigratorySpecies_Fish/MapServer/0 Metadata link: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/66145 Data availability: Yes Data categories: Highly migratory fish Data type: spatial 9.5.3 Project description Feature layer (polygons) of essential fish habitat for highly migratory fish species 9.6 HighlyMigratorySpecies_Sharks 9.6.1 Project information Lead entity: NOAA Partner entities: NA PI name: NOAA OCM PI contact information: coastal.info@noaa.gov Data start year: 2021 Data end year: 2024 Spatial scale: USA 9.6.2 Data information Project link: https://coast.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OceanReports/HighlyMigratorySpecies_Sharks/MapServer Data link: https://coast.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OceanReports/HighlyMigratorySpecies_Sharks/MapServer/0 Metadata link: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/66145 Data availability: Yes Data categories: Highly migratory fish Data type: spatial 9.6.3 Project description Feature layer (polygons) of essential fish habitat for highly migratory shark species 9.7 State of the Ecosystem {ecodata} R package 9.7.1 Project information Lead entity: NOAA NEFSC Partner entities: NA PI name: Brandon Beltz PI contact information: brandon.beltz@noaa.gov Data start year: 2017 Data end year: 2025 Spatial scale: Northwest Atlantic 9.7.2 Data information Project link: https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata Data link: NA Metadata link: NA Data availability: Yes Data categories: Acoustic, Chemical oceanography, Physical oceanography, Marine mammals, Plankton, Forage fish, Protected fish, Highly migratory fish Data type: “research project, synthesis, or technology development” 9.7.3 Project description ecodata is an R data package developed by the Ecosystems Dynamics and Assessment Branch of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center for use in State of the Ecosystem (SOE) reporting. 9.8 State of the Ecosystem Catalog 9.8.1 Project information Lead entity: NOAA NEFSC Partner entities: NA PI name: Brandon Beltz PI contact information: brandon.beltz@noaa.gov Data start year: 2017 Data end year: 2025 Spatial scale: Northwest Atlantic 9.8.2 Data information Project link: https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/catalog Data link: NA Metadata link: NA Data availability: Yes Data categories: Acoustic, Chemical oceanography, Physical oceanography, Marine mammals, Plankton, Forage fish, Protected fish, Highly migratory fish Data type: “research project, synthesis, or technology development” 9.8.3 Project description Catalog of indicators used in the State of the Ecosystem reports and other ecosystem assessment products. 9.9 ME Research Array - HMS Monitoring 9.9.1 Project information Lead entity: Maine DMR Partner entities: University of Maine, GMRI PI name: Matt Davis PI contact information: matthew.m.davis@maine.gov Data start year: 2022 Data end year: Unknown Spatial scale: Project 9.9.2 Data information Project link: https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science/wind-research Data link: NA Metadata link: NA Data availability: No Data categories: Highly migratory fish, Acoustic Data type: spatial 9.9.3 Project description This project aims to study the distribution and habitat use of highly migratory species in relation to proposed offshore wind areas in the Gulf of Maine.

The goal of this study is to determine the seasonal movement and habitat use of Striped Bass and Atlantic Sturgeon in the Saco River. Using acoustic telemetry, this study established a network of passive receivers to better understand Striped Bass seasonal movements in the Saco River, and throughout their coastal migratory range. The Gulf of Maine Distinct Population Segment of Atlantic Sturgeon are listed as threatened. Atlantic Sturgeon utilize the Saco River as a feeding ground, but move among nearby rivers. Characterizing seasonal presence and connectivity of Atlantic Sturgeon among Maine Rivers, is essential to better understand dynamics of threatened populations. Fish are internally tagged with V13 or V16 acoustic tag. Receivers are located throughout the Saco River and Saco Bay and deployed from June to November.

Genetic assignment data will be generated by USGS using the latest baseline for the species, leveraging existing genotype data (874 telemetered individuals) and additional samples collected for this study. Synthesizing this information, DPS-specific migration maps will be generated showing the seasonal patterns of Atlantic sturgeon occupancy along the Atlantic coast. Spatial and temporal occurrence data from the telemetry data would be divided by DPS and life-history stage. This information would then be compared to the location of proposed offshore wind energy projects to help characterize relative risk of projects to different DPSs and life history stages of Atlantic sturgeon.

White) derived from fisheries and observer-based sampling programs (e.g., AMAPPS). This project proposes identifying which species and guilds eDNA resolves well and those it misidentifies with an ecosystem-based context. For example, seabirds and invertebrates (e.g., clams) have been overlooked in most eDNA studies, even though these communities are essential in BOEM assessments and by other federal agencies. We will evaluate how well eDNA metabarcoding resolves marine communities using retrospective analyses (persistent communities) and simultaneous observations (observers; net tows; aerial cameras). The main objectives are to identify strengths and weaknesses in methodology; address weaknesses by populating genetic databases where feasible, and guide future BOEM projects across the regions.

The sea sampling program was initiated at the request of industry, managers and scientists as there was a lack of information on the discarded portion of the lobster. Over the years, the program has expanded to become the largest at-sea sampling program for lobster in the northeast. Time-series of catch rates and biological data have been used in numerous investigations of width/length relationships, fecundity, size-at-maturity, sex ratio, geographic variation, growth, V-notch composition, and selectivity. Data from the sea sampling program contribute directly to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) American lobster stock assessment. 12.6 American Lobster Settlement Survey 12.6.1 Project information Lead entity: ME DMR Partner entities: University of Maine, Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences PI name: Kathleen Reardon PI contact information: Kathleen.Reardon@maine.gov Data start year: 1989 Data end year: Present Spatial scale: State 12.6.2 Data information Project link: https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science/species-information/maine-lobster/surveys/settlement-survey Data link: NA Metadata link: NA Data availability: No Data categories: Crustaceans Data type: spatial 12.6.3 Project description Surveys of the Maine juvenile lobster population were started in the Midcoast region (Zone E) in 1989 by researchers at the University of Maine and the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences. In 2000, the settlement surveys were expanded to cover all seven of Maine’s lobster management zones in order to create a statewide index of settlement. In 2005, the Maine Department of Marine Resources (DMR) fully took over the monitoring effort in Maine. Settlement surveys using the same methodologies as Maine are conducted throughout New England and Maritime Canada. In 2012 data from these various groups was brought together in a single publicly accessible database called ALSI (American Lobster Settlement Index). This collaborative provides standardization in sampling methods and facilitates data analysis across all sampling programs. Using this type of fishery-independent survey, researchers at the University of Maine and the DMR hope to track juvenile populations and generate predictive models of future landings. 12.7 Maine Department of Marine Resources plankton and larval lobster survey 12.7.1 Project information Lead entity: Maine Department of Marine Resources Partner entities: Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, University of Maine, University of Southern Maine PI name: Unknown PI contact information: offshorewind@maine.gov Data start year: 2024 Data end year: 2030 Spatial scale: Project 12.7.2 Data information Project link: https://www.maine.gov/dmr/node/1467 Data link: NA Metadata link: NA Data availability: No Data categories: Plankton, Crustaceans Data type: spatial 12.7.3 Project description Vertical plankton tows goal: Understand baseline water conditions, stratification, and plankton community composition and distribution and determine if they change during and after turbine installation Horizontal neuston tows goal: To understand baseline larval lobster abundance and distribution and determine if it changes after turbine installation [1] “This data was sourced from: RWSC_early-2025” 12.8 Shrimp Survey Data 12.8.1 Project information Lead entity: NOAA NEFSC Partner entities: NA PI name: Peter D Chase PI contact information: peter.chase@noaa.gov Data start year: 1983 Data end year: Present Spatial scale: Gulf of Maine 12.8.2 Data information Project link: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/25087 Data link: NA Metadata link: NA Data availability: Yes Data categories: Crustaceans Data type: spatial 12.8.3 Project description The Northern Shrimp Survey was initiated in 1983 by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) and monitors the relative abundance (number of shrimp), biomass (weight of shrimp), and composition of the northern shrimp stock throughout the Gulf of Maine. The data give an understanding of year class strength and sex stage and maturity of shrimp in the population. The survey focuses its efforts in offshore waters (in depths greater than 50 meters) and is timed to sample both males and females during the summer when they are expected to be offshore. The data it collects forms the basis of the annual northern shrimp assessment, which in turn, is used by fishery managers from Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts to set each year’s fishing regulations.

This is the first time researchers have successfully tagged an endangered species in the United States using an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone. The collected data will shed important light on the whales’ acoustic behavior, which researchers will use to inform mitigation strategies – including passive acoustic monitoring – to protect this endangered species from the potential impacts of offshore wind energy activities. Digital acoustic tagging is a component of a larger BOEM study into the Spatial and Acoustic Behavior of Endangered Large Whales to address gaps in information on a variety of endangered large whale species – including sei, North Atlantic right, and fin whales – to better inform offshore wind energy area selection. UAVs enable researchers to target specific animals in a group or conduct multi-group taggings, and the collected data will also aid in conservation efforts. The same project tagged NARW in Mid-Atlantic (2023) and basking sharks in Vineyard Sound (June and Fall 2022).

Some have experimented with pressure sensors, acoustic listening devices, cameras, satellite-tracked drifters, current meters, and salinity monitors but the primary focus has been monitoring temperature. While some gear are fitted with internally-recording devices that have returned more than two decades of hourly data from fixed locations, most of the vessels are now fitted with a satellite transmitter and, most recently, with cell phones so that tens of thousands of hauls have been reported in realtime since 2015. The original focus was on bottom temperature but, beginning in 2020, most vessels are now equipped with water column profilers to document the vertical stratification of temperature and several are collecting records of dissolved oxygen.

Since 2008, the Ocean Tracking Network, with the support of DFO, has maintained an acoustic receiver curtain to track movements of a variety of acoustically tagged species moving laterally along the East Coast continental shelf, as well as year round and seasonal residents in the Halifax Region. The OTN Halifax line spans the entire width of the continental shelf off Halifax and consists of hydrophone moorings at 800 m spacing over a total length of almost 205 km. This makes it the largest single fixed oceanographic monitoring system in the world. The line meanders to avoid areas of intense trawling activity such as the Emerald Basin. In addition to acoustic receivers, several of these moorings contain benthic pods: instrumented packages that provide time series of bottom pressure (sea level height), temperature and salinity. This massive undertaking took four years to fully deploy. Data stored on receivers or benthic pods are retrieved via autonomous vehicles (gliders), as well as manned vessels. Marine species tagged in over 20 OTN projects have been detected on this line to date. This array has bennefited many telemetry investigations (salmon, sturgeon, etc) within the U.S. and Canada.

The dataset was compiled by the NOAA NEFSC Passive Acoustic Research Program using detection data collected by many collaborators. Information on data ownership can be found in the metadata of each station or platform. Species that are currently represented include the North Atlantic right whale, fin whale, humpback whale, sei whale, blue whale, sperm whale, beaked whale species, and Kogia species (dwarf/pygmy sperm whales). The specific call types used for each species along with other metadata related to the recording and detection analysis can be found by hovering over or clicking on each platform Acoustic detections were recorded using stationary (bottom-mounted moorings, surface buoys) and mobile (autonomous gliders and towed arrays) platforms. These acoustic detections only represent times when animals are calling; they do not capture time periods when animals are present but silent. Detections are from archival acoustic recorders and do not show recorders currently in the water (this is not a real-time tool). Differences in recorder detection ranges for each species are not accounted for; they can vary based on differences in instrumentation (i.e., recording hardware), environmental conditions (i.e., weather, bottom type, ambient sound levels), and anthropogenic sound levels.

The goal of this study is to determine the seasonal movement and habitat use of Striped Bass and Atlantic Sturgeon in the Saco River. Using acoustic telemetry, this study established a network of passive receivers to better understand Striped Bass seasonal movements in the Saco River, and throughout their coastal migratory range. The Gulf of Maine Distinct Population Segment of Atlantic Sturgeon are listed as threatened. Atlantic Sturgeon utilize the Saco River as a feeding ground, but move among nearby rivers. Characterizing seasonal presence and connectivity of Atlantic Sturgeon among Maine Rivers, is essential to better understand dynamics of threatened populations. Fish are internally tagged with V13 or V16 acoustic tag. Receivers are located throughout the Saco River and Saco Bay and deployed from June to November.

In 2025 MassDMF initiated a passive acoustic monitoring program to enhance our understanding of the seasonal presence of North Atlantic right whales in Massachusetts coastal waters. The monitoring network includes both near real-time and archival detection methods to collect data on right whale vocalizations. DMF is partnering with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to operate two near real-time passive acoustic buoys (one in Cape Cod Bay and another off Gloucester) which relay large whale call detections via satellite every two hours. The real-time (DMON) buoys were deployed southeast of Cape Ann, and in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts on February 23, 2025. Detections can be found at the publicly accessible website Robots4Whales. In addition, DMF is deploying bottom-mounted acoustic monitors at 17 different sites across Massachusetts state waters and adjacent federal waters. These monitors are archival, collecting data for five months before being called to the surface for servicing, data downloading, and redeployment. The data collected through this acoustic monitoring network will enhance our understanding of the spatial and temporal presence of North Atlantic right whales, aid in the development of occupancy estimates, and increase the efficiency of dynamic management of fixed gear closures meant to protect right whales from entanglement. Real-time detections will improve our confidence in the decision to extend or open the closure of the Massachusetts Restricted Area due to right whale presence or absence. Archival data will be analyzed for seasonal and temporal patterns in detections, aiding in the estimates of right whale density and occupancy in New England waters, which can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation measures and aid in the development of future measures to reduce risk of entanglement and ship strike.

White) derived from fisheries and observer-based sampling programs (e.g., AMAPPS). This project proposes identifying which species and guilds eDNA resolves well and those it misidentifies with an ecosystem-based context. For example, seabirds and invertebrates (e.g., clams) have been overlooked in most eDNA studies, even though these communities are essential in BOEM assessments and by other federal agencies. We will evaluate how well eDNA metabarcoding resolves marine communities using retrospective analyses (persistent communities) and simultaneous observations (observers; net tows; aerial cameras). The main objectives are to identify strengths and weaknesses in methodology; address weaknesses by populating genetic databases where feasible, and guide future BOEM projects across the regions.

This is the first time researchers have successfully tagged an endangered species in the United States using an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone. The collected data will shed important light on the whales’ acoustic behavior, which researchers will use to inform mitigation strategies – including passive acoustic monitoring – to protect this endangered species from the potential impacts of offshore wind energy activities. Digital acoustic tagging is a component of a larger BOEM study into the Spatial and Acoustic Behavior of Endangered Large Whales to address gaps in information on a variety of endangered large whale species – including sei, North Atlantic right, and fin whales – to better inform offshore wind energy area selection. UAVs enable researchers to target specific animals in a group or conduct multi-group taggings, and the collected data will also aid in conservation efforts. The same project tagged NARW in Mid-Atlantic (2023) and basking sharks in Vineyard Sound (June and Fall 2022).

The effort will coordinate with USFWS and others that may be surveying in the Gulf of Maine. A detailed field plan will be developed describing survey methods, survey protocols, proposed track lines, and survey schedule. The plan will also include details on the collection of digital imagery, methods for processing the images, camera design, and methods for identifying the species, methods to estimate bird flight heights, methods for collection of visible features of potential interest to energy development (such as oceanographic features, vessels, fishing activity [e.g., buoys], and other human uses). The data collected from these baseline surveys will be added into databases like the Compendium of Avian Occurrence Information database and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System Spatial Ecological Analysis of Megavertebrate Populations (OBIS-SEAMAP). Ultimately, the baseline data could then be used to update avian and other wildlife distributional maps like those developed through BOEM’s interagency agreement with NOAA (Winship et al. 2018) and distributed to the regional data portals.

The models estimate absolute density, rendered as maps of the number of individual animals per 100 km2, by statistically correlating sightings reported on shipboard and aerial surveys with oceanographic conditions. Since its initial publication in 2016, the project has expanded to utilize over 2.8 million linear kilometers of survey effort collected between 1992-2020, yielding density maps for over 30 species and multi-species guilds, including cetaceans and pinnipeds. These density maps serve as crucial pre-development estimates of marine mammal distributions.

This array will likely expand its scope in the future, adding 7 additional moorings in 2023, as Maine seeks to better understand a) the distribution of baleen whales within the Gulf of Maine and b) baseline ambient noise levels prior to offshore wind development. The spatial coverage of this array may also serve as a bountiful platform of opportunity for tagging studies not only within the Department, but the region. Maine is happy to engage in these data-sharing efforts for the benefit of knowledge beyond its immediate purposes. Tagged protected fish will be detected on the receivers.

The dataset was compiled by the NOAA NEFSC Passive Acoustic Research Program using detection data collected by many collaborators. Information on data ownership can be found in the metadata of each station or platform. Species that are currently represented include the North Atlantic right whale, fin whale, humpback whale, sei whale, blue whale, sperm whale, beaked whale species, and Kogia species (dwarf/pygmy sperm whales). The specific call types used for each species along with other metadata related to the recording and detection analysis can be found by hovering over or clicking on each platform Acoustic detections were recorded using stationary (bottom-mounted moorings, surface buoys) and mobile (autonomous gliders and towed arrays) platforms. These acoustic detections only represent times when animals are calling; they do not capture time periods when animals are present but silent. Detections are from archival acoustic recorders and do not show recorders currently in the water (this is not a real-time tool). Differences in recorder detection ranges for each species are not accounted for; they can vary based on differences in instrumentation (i.e., recording hardware), environmental conditions (i.e., weather, bottom type, ambient sound levels), and anthropogenic sound levels.

In 2025 MassDMF initiated a passive acoustic monitoring program to enhance our understanding of the seasonal presence of North Atlantic right whales in Massachusetts coastal waters. The monitoring network includes both near real-time and archival detection methods to collect data on right whale vocalizations. DMF is partnering with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to operate two near real-time passive acoustic buoys (one in Cape Cod Bay and another off Gloucester) which relay large whale call detections via satellite every two hours. The real-time (DMON) buoys were deployed southeast of Cape Ann, and in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts on February 23, 2025. Detections can be found at the publicly accessible website Robots4Whales. In addition, DMF is deploying bottom-mounted acoustic monitors at 17 different sites across Massachusetts state waters and adjacent federal waters. These monitors are archival, collecting data for five months before being called to the surface for servicing, data downloading, and redeployment. The data collected through this acoustic monitoring network will enhance our understanding of the spatial and temporal presence of North Atlantic right whales, aid in the development of occupancy estimates, and increase the efficiency of dynamic management of fixed gear closures meant to protect right whales from entanglement. Real-time detections will improve our confidence in the decision to extend or open the closure of the Massachusetts Restricted Area due to right whale presence or absence. Archival data will be analyzed for seasonal and temporal patterns in detections, aiding in the estimates of right whale density and occupancy in New England waters, which can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation measures and aid in the development of future measures to reduce risk of entanglement and ship strike.

White) derived from fisheries and observer-based sampling programs (e.g., AMAPPS). This project proposes identifying which species and guilds eDNA resolves well and those it misidentifies with an ecosystem-based context. For example, seabirds and invertebrates (e.g., clams) have been overlooked in most eDNA studies, even though these communities are essential in BOEM assessments and by other federal agencies. We will evaluate how well eDNA metabarcoding resolves marine communities using retrospective analyses (persistent communities) and simultaneous observations (observers; net tows; aerial cameras). The main objectives are to identify strengths and weaknesses in methodology; address weaknesses by populating genetic databases where feasible, and guide future BOEM projects across the regions.

The effort will coordinate with USFWS and others that may be surveying in the Gulf of Maine. A detailed field plan will be developed describing survey methods, survey protocols, proposed track lines, and survey schedule. The plan will also include details on the collection of digital imagery, methods for processing the images, camera design, and methods for identifying the species, methods to estimate bird flight heights, methods for collection of visible features of potential interest to energy development (such as oceanographic features, vessels, fishing activity [e.g., buoys], and other human uses). The data collected from these baseline surveys will be added into databases like the Compendium of Avian Occurrence Information database and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System Spatial Ecological Analysis of Megavertebrate Populations (OBIS-SEAMAP). Ultimately, the baseline data could then be used to update avian and other wildlife distributional maps like those developed through BOEM’s interagency agreement with NOAA (Winship et al. 2018) and distributed to the regional data portals.

Marine ecosystems are complex and difficult to monitor, making the prediction of future changes a daunting task. Seabirds are often suggested as potential bioindicators, yet the development of their data for general predictive use is rare. I, using the data of many collaborators, examined the potential use of Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea) diet and demographic data as bioindicators in the rapidly warming Gulf of Maine (GOM) ecosystem. The collapse of the breeding colony at Machias Seal Island, formerly the largest in North America, was primarily driven by unmitigated egg predation by large Larus gulls, not a decline in Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). At the metapopulation scale, reproductive success of Arctic Terns was subject to multiple environmental interactions. The proximity of a colony to shore was associated with higher diet quality, but also greater predator pressures. Interactions between diet quality, weather, and predator behaviour strongly influenced the reproductive success of terns. At the ecosystem scale, the diets of Arctic and Common Terns (S. hirundo) could be combined with environmental data to describe and track ecosystem states. Arctic Terns were more likely to consume white hake (Urophycis tenuis) and small marine invertebrates, but their dietary trends also tracked measures of the herring stock and fishery. Common Terns were more likely to target high-lipid fish, but they showed stronger spatial trends that limited regional inferences. Finally, I estimated rates of survival, dispersal, and return rates. Arctic Terns have strong dispersal behaviour and regularly leave the major colonies of the GOM, but adult survival has not changed, despite major warming. Multiple types of tern data indicated that the weakest period of the past 30 years was between 2004-2012, when salinity was reduced and small copepods like Centropages typicus were less abundant. Arctic Terns were able to react to major declines in habitat quality, and have adjusted well to recent warming. Although Arctic Terns are affected by both top-down and bottom-up forcing, their diet and demographic data are useful as indicators. Terns could function well as ecosystem, guild-, or site-specific indicators, depending on the desired use. 16.4 Digital aerial surveys for wildlife in the Gulf of Maine 16.4.1 Project information Lead entity: Biodiversity Research Institute Partner entities: HiDef Aerial Surveying PI name: Iain Stenhouse PI contact information: iain.stenhouse@briwildlife.org Data start year: 2023 Data end year: 2024 Spatial scale: Gulf of Maine 16.4.2 Data information Project link: https://briwildlife.org/digital-aerial-surveys/ Data link: NA Metadata link: NA Data availability: No Data categories: Seabirds, Marine mammals Data type: spatial 16.4.3 Project description BRI, in collaboration with HiDef Aerial Surveying, is conducting digital video aerial surveys to obtain ecological baseline data and to inform siting of offshore wind development in the Gulf of Maine.

Algorithms will likely operate in stages, with an initial stage developed to detect possible targets and sort images with and without targets, and subsequent stages to enumerate and classify targets. Labeled image datasets are being developed to train the algorithms. Sea ducks are manually identified and annotated from representative imagery. Annotation of targets will be commensurate with study objectives (initially species level classification) and capture the variability in appearance of targets and target backgrounds to maximize classification accuracy of deep learning algorithms. For this study, we are annotating to the lowest taxonomic level and incorporating information on age, gender, and activity when resolvable. Auxiliary information such as imagery metadata and georeferencing will support advanced analysis with these data in the future.

White) derived from fisheries and observer-based sampling programs (e.g., AMAPPS). This project proposes identifying which species and guilds eDNA resolves well and those it misidentifies with an ecosystem-based context. For example, seabirds and invertebrates (e.g., clams) have been overlooked in most eDNA studies, even though these communities are essential in BOEM assessments and by other federal agencies. We will evaluate how well eDNA metabarcoding resolves marine communities using retrospective analyses (persistent communities) and simultaneous observations (observers; net tows; aerial cameras). The main objectives are to identify strengths and weaknesses in methodology; address weaknesses by populating genetic databases where feasible, and guide future BOEM projects across the regions.

The effort will coordinate with USFWS and others that may be surveying in the Gulf of Maine. A detailed field plan will be developed describing survey methods, survey protocols, proposed track lines, and survey schedule. The plan will also include details on the collection of digital imagery, methods for processing the images, camera design, and methods for identifying the species, methods to estimate bird flight heights, methods for collection of visible features of potential interest to energy development (such as oceanographic features, vessels, fishing activity [e.g., buoys], and other human uses). The data collected from these baseline surveys will be added into databases like the Compendium of Avian Occurrence Information database and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System Spatial Ecological Analysis of Megavertebrate Populations (OBIS-SEAMAP). Ultimately, the baseline data could then be used to update avian and other wildlife distributional maps like those developed through BOEM’s interagency agreement with NOAA (Winship et al. 2018) and distributed to the regional data portals.

The information provided on the open data web site can be used to identify areas where seabirds at sea are found in eastern Canada. However, low survey effort or high variation in some areas introduces uncertainty in the density estimates provided. The data and maps found on the open data web site should therefore be interpreted with an understanding of this uncertainty. Data were collected using ships of opportunity surveys and therefore spatial and seasonal coverage varies considerably. Densities are computed using distance sampling to adjust for variation in detection rates among observers and survey conditions. Depending on conditions, seabirds can be difficult to identify to species level. Therefore, densities at higher taxonomic levels are provided. more details in the document: Atlas_SeabirdsAtSea-OiseauxMarinsEnMer.pdf. By clicking on “View on Map” you will visualize a example of the density measured for all species combined from April to July - 2006-2020. ESRI REST or WMS map services can be added to your web maps or opened directly in your desktop mapping applications. These are alternatives to downloading and provide densities for all taxonomical groups and species as well as survey effort.
